# Pig Latin Translator
This project was built with Javascript, HTML and CSS.

To use, simply type the phrase or word that you wish to translate into the top input box. Upon clicking on Waddles (the pig button), the user's input will be translated into Pig Latin and returned in the output box. A "Refresh" button has been placed below the output. If clicked, both the input box and the output box will be cleared.


### Rules of Pig Latin

- For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
- For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive   consonants to the end, and add "ay".
- If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!
- For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.
